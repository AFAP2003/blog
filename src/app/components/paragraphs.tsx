    "A baseball star has reportedly agreed a 15-year $765m (£600m) deal with the New York Mets - one of the richest contracts in sport history.",
    "Juan Soto, 26, will join the Mets after spending one season with cross-town rival the New York Yankees.",
"The deal was first reported by ESPN which said the agreement offers Soto an opt-out option after five years - and the contract could end up being worth over $800m (£626m).",
"The Yankees had been willing to offer the Dominican outfielder a contract worth $760m (£595m) over 16 years but they were outbid by the Mets, according to The New York Post.",
"Despite his young age, Soto has established himself as one of the best hitters in Major League Baseball and placed his name next to some of the greatest players in the sport's history.",
"In August 2019, he became the fourth player in top level baseball history to record 100 extra-base hits before his 21st birthday.",
"He is one of just seven players with a 30-plus home run season before turning 21.",
"Soto also won the World Series with the Washington Nationals in 2019.",
"The reported agreement would be the largest and longest in Major League Baseball history, topping Shohei Ohtani's $700m (£548m), 10-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, which was signed last December.",
"Shortly after the signing, however, reports surfaced that Ohtani was deferring $68m (£53m) of the $70m (£55m) he is due each season, with Los Angeles paying him through to 2043.",
"However, none of the money in the Soto deal is deferred - meaning it will be paid out across 15 years if he doesn't opt out after five.",
"While there are no definitive records in sports beyond the United States, Soto's deal is thought to eclipse those in all other team sports.",
"The baseball star will reportedly earn $805m (£630m) if he chooses to continue his contract after five years.",
"This means he will earn $51m (£40m) a year in his first five years, and $55m (£43m) a year in the remaining 10.",
"There are 162 games in a regular Major League Baseball season - with Soto's $805m meaning he will have earned just over $331,000 (£259,000) a game after 15 years.",
"There's no set time limit for a baseball game, which typically has nine innings. In recent seasons, these games have reportedly averaged at around 2 hours and 36 minutes in length.",
"On this basis, Soto will have earned around $2,100 (£1,643) a minute during each game after 15 years."

    "It's taken a whopping 632 days to complete and generated billions of dollars as it travelled the globe, but now Taylor Swift's Eras tour is finally over.",
    "Kicking off in Glendale, Arizona, on 17 March last year and finishing in Vancouver, British Columbia on 8 December, it was perhaps bigger than even Swift could ever have dreamed.",
    "Made up of 149 shows, each running for around three hours, the elaborate performance featured multiple costume changes and a set list of more than 40 songs.",
    "Spanning five continents, the tour has become the highest-grossing of all time and the second most attended, seen by 10.1 million fans worldwide (it was narrowly pipped to the post by Coldplay, with 10.3 million expected to attend their 175 shows).",
    'Serenaded with Happy Birthday by the Vancouver crowd ahead of her 35th birthday next week, an emotional Swift called it "the adventure of a lifetime" and "the most thrilling chapter of my entire life to date".',
    "The show has been a cultural touchstone, attended by fans, celebrities including Jennifer Lopez, Julia Roberts and Adam Sandler and even the UK's own prime minister (which later led to questions over government intervention in Swift's security escort for the shows).",
    'During the tour, the singer-songwriter has re-released multiple albums (and one double-feature of new material), donated to foodbanks in every city she visited, and proved an economic angel boosting the local economies of each city she passed through, earning her own economic term - "Swiftenomics".',
    "Her first London shows saw her make headlines worldwide after bringing out her American football player boyfriend Travis Kelce for a surprise appearance.",
    "She went on to make history as the first solo artist to perform at Wembley Stadium eight times on a single tour.",
    "But her return to London two months later came after a difficult few weeks for the star. In July, three young girls died during a stabbing at a dance class inspired by her music in Southport.",
    'Swift said she was "completely in shock" at the "horror" of what happened.',
    `Then, just days later, all three of Swift's shows in Vienna were cancelled over a suspected terrorist plot, in which the suspects had sought to kill "tens of thousands" of fans.`,
    `When I tell you I witnessed something last night that I've never experienced before and frankly, may never experience again," he told his four million Instagram followers.`,
    `Paying tribute to Swift's "kindhearted" family, Buble dubbed her a "truly an incredible entertainer," calling her "power of connection" with her fans "a testament to Taylor's incredible talents".`,
    'Wrapping her final show, Swift told the audience: "It has been the most exciting, powerful, electrifying, intense, most challenging thing I have ever done in my entire life.',
    `"We have got to perform for over 10 million people on this tour and tonight we get to play one last show for you tonight, in beautiful Vancouver."`,
    `And while there was no big announcement to mark the end of the tour (as is often Swift's way at key moments in her career), she's still topping the UK album charts as The Tortured Poets Department soared back up this week after a new anthology version was released.`,
    "The Eras Tour may be over, but Swift, it seems, is only just getting started."

    'The programme, he said, will begin with undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes - although he did not reveal which ones - and then turn to "people outside of criminals".',
    'The US president-elect said there was "no choice".',

    'Asked specifically about the future of people who were brought into the country illegally as children and have been shielded from deportation in recent years, Mr Trump said, "I want to work something out" - indicating he might seek a solution with Congress.',

    `He wouldn't confirm if he had spoken to Russia's leader since winning the election in November because he said he didn't want "to do anything that could impede the negotiation".`,
    "The former president's call for an immediate ceasefire goes further than anything incumbent president Joe Biden has said.",
    "It's his clearest effort so far to resolve one of the world's major crises before taking office on 20 January and contrasts with the Biden administration, which has made a point of not being seen to press Kyiv for an immediate truce.",

    "Google has unveiled a computing chip capable of solving problems in minutes that would take one of today's fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years to complete.",
    "As well as being extremely fast, the experimental quantum chip, called Willow, can reduce errors exponentially. That's important because currently, quantum computers exponentially create errors, according to Google.",
'Hartmut Neven, the founder of Google Quantum AI, said: "The more qubits we use in Willow, the more we reduce errors, and the more quantum the system becomes."',
'A "qubit" is a unit of information in quantum computing, like a "bit" in classic computing. A system is described as becoming "more" quantum the faster it solves problems.',
"Google says its Willow quantum chip was created in Santa Barbara, in one of only a few facilities in the world built from the ground up for this purpose.",
'In order to make a chip this advanced, the team behind Willow had to make sure every element was "well-functioning".',
`"If any component lags or if two components don't function well together, it drags down system performance," said Mr Neven in a blog post.`,
'The team tested Willow against an existing supercomputer using a test called the "random circuit sampling (RCS) benchmark".',
`If a quantum computer can't beat a classical computer in reaching that benchmark, "there is strong reason for scepticism that it can tackle more complex quantum tasks", according to Mr Neven.`,
`Willow's "astonishing" performance meant it performed a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today's fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years, or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.`,
"That's thousands of billions of years - and longer than the age of the universe.",
"At the moment, quantum computing is still experimental. In the future, though, it is expected to speed up many processes - from making medicines to nuclear fusion research.",
"However, it's feared the technology could allow hackers to be more efficient, too.",

    "Companies, organisations and other parties must immediately do more to bolster their resilience to the evolving risk posed by increasingly sophisticated cyber weapons, enhanced by artificial intelligence, that can be used by hostile states and criminals, the NCSC said in an annual review published on Tuesday.",
    'The gap between the complexity of the attacks and the means to defend against them is "widening" and "will only become more pronounced over time", it said.',

    '"Of these incidents, 89 were nationally significant, 12 of which were at the top end of the scale and more severe in nature (which is a three-fold increase on last year)," the report said.',
    "They included a cyber attack against a company called Synnovis that provides blood testing services to the NHS, which impacted hospitals across London, endangering patients.",
    'The NCSC did not say how many of the gravest attacks were carried out by hostile states but it listed China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as being "real and enduring threats".',
    'As for the type of hacks, it warned that ransomware attacks pose "the most immediate and disruptive threat to our critical national infrastructure", revealing that some state-linked cyber groups are targeting the industrial control systems that infrastructure relies on.',

    'Mr Horne will highlight the advice and guidance that the NCSC publishes to help the public and private sectors, as well as individuals, build up their cyber defences.',
    '"The reality is that advice, that guidance, those frameworks need to be put into practice much more across the board," he will say.',
    '"There is no room for complacency about the severity of state-led threats or the volume of the threat posed by cybercriminals. The defence and resilience of critical infrastructure, supply chains, the public sector and our wider economy must improve."',
